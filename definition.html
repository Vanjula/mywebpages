Companies that build digital products strive to address the preferences of their customers as accurately as possible.
That’s why UX and UI design jobs are on the rise. According to the analytics platform Burning Glass, the average time
required to fill a UI or UX position is 41 days. This is a lot – and it means that the demand for jobs like that is high.</pre></p>
<h1>WHAT IS UI/UX DESIGN?</h1>
<p><pre>It’s common to use UI and UX interchangeably, but they are actually two different things. 

<strong>UI (user interface)</strong> design is all about what users actually see on the application’s screen – text, colors, backgrounds, icons, and moving elements like animations.
That’s why UI design overlaps with graphic design. The career path in UI design is quite similar to graphic design – graphic design education and experience in product
development projects are a big plus for UI designers.

<strong>UX (user experience)</strong> design focuses on studying how users move through all the different elements of the UI.
For UX designers, it’s all about the flow of the user experience and eliminating any sources of friction during these interactions. 
That’s why UX designers need to know the methods and tools for studying user behaviors – and then translate their insights into design 
guidelines or principles. A UX designer is responsible for making products usable, enjoyable, and accessible to users. 

While UI handles the look of a digital product, UX handles how all of the UI elements work together to create a seamless user experience.  

A<strong> UX/UI designer combines these two areas</strong> by carrying out user research first, and then implementing the findings in the visual design in the form 
of mockups, wireframes, and prototypes. These are then tested, and user feedback is gathered to inform further changes and bring the product to the 
greatest possible shape before the launch.

<h1>wHAT SKILLS DOES A UI/UX DESIGNER NEED?</h1>

<p><pre>
<strong>To carry out such a varied range of tasks, UX designers need a diverse skillset:</strong>

– Technical and design skills – wireframing and prototyping with the help of various digital tools. 
– Analytical skills – ability to interpret data and feedback correctly, problem-solving skills. 
– Empathy – the ability to step into the shoes of different types of users.
– Communication and teamwork – working in a team is the most common setup for UX/UI designers, so they need 
to know how to collaborate with clients, stakeholders, developers, and even fellow designers.
– Business acumen – ability to understand the business objectives and processes and aligning them with the needs of the target audience.  
These skills are just that foundation. To become a successful UX/UI designer, you also need to know how to carry out user research, 
know the process of prototyping like the back of your hand, and be familiar with the fundamentals of good design. 

The designers who truly distinguish themselves have skills that allow them to approach challenges holistically, using methods 
such as design thinking or data visualization.
